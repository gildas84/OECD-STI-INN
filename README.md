# OECD-STI-INN
Ths repository tracks the evolution of the NLP pilot study of OECD's country Innovation policy

The pilot project uses topic modeling, a technique to extract the hidden topics from large volumes of text. It will rely on Gensim library. More on : https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/topic-modeling-gensim-python/
A satisfactory topic modelling will rely on the quality of text pre-processing and finding an optimal number of topics.
Text pre-processing includes: Lowercasing, removal of extra whitespaces, removal of non-alphanumeric characters, tokenization, spelling correction, remove stopwords, punctuations and frequent words, and lemmatisation (with optional stemming).
